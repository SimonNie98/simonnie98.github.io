I received my B.E. degree in School of Computer Science and Technology from Fudan University, Shanghai, in 2021. And in July 31, 2024, I will receive my Mphil. degree in Department of Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research interests include the NVMe SSDs, Zoned Namespace (ZNS) interface, and Flexible Data Placement (FDP). Also I am interested in MLSys related topic. Currently I am working as an intern in the CDN group of Tencent.
